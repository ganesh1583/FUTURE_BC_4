Future Interns Task 4
As part of my journey with Future Interns, I’ve been getting hands-on experience with real blockchain platforms through airdrops — not just to earn tokens, but to understand how decentralized systems function in the real world.

Here are a few platforms I’ve explored so far:
PublicAI – An AI-powered tool that lets users create and test assistants. It was insightful to experiment with prompts and see how AI can integrate with Web3 applications.
Gradient Network – Their dashboard offers a clear view into Web3 data and analytics, giving me a better understanding of how developers work with decentralized tools.
OneFootball Club – Even though I’m not a football follower, it was interesting to see how NFTs are being used to connect fans and create new digital experiences in sports.
This task has been a great way to build a working knowledge of wallets, dApps, airdrops, and token systems. I'm currently exploring the next platforms and continuing to learn by doing.
